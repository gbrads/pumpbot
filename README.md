   - Add your funding wallet private key
   - Add your base wallet address for consolidation
   - Add token creation wallets (WALLET_A and WALLET_B)

## Configuration Files

### .env
Contains all private keys and configuration:
- `PUMP_FUN_RPC`: Your Solana RPC endpoint
- `FUNDING_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY`: Wallet used to fund new wallets
- `BASE_WALLET_ADDRESS`: Wallet to receive consolidated SOL
- `WALLET_A_PRIVATE_KEY`: Creator wallet for token launch
- `WALLET_B_PRIVATE_KEY`: Initial buyer wallet for token launch
- `WALLET_X_PRIVATE_KEY`: Generated wallet private keys

### wallets.json
Contains public information about your wallets:
- Wallet names
- Public keys
- Delay settings for transactions

### private_keys_backup.json
Maintains a historical record of all generated wallets with timestamps.

## Usage

Launch the CLI interface:

bash
npm start

## Wallet Management

### Generating New Wallets
1. Select "Fund Wallets" from the main menu
2. Enter number of wallets to create
3. Specify SOL amount per wallet
4. Confirm the transaction

### Private Key Storage
- Private keys are stored in `.env` for active use
- Backup copy in `private_keys_backup.json`
- Each generation batch is timestamped
- Never delete `private_keys_backup.json`

## Transaction Settings

### Delay Configuration
Edit `wallets.json` to modify:
- `min`: Minimum delay between transactions (ms)
- `max`: Maximum delay between transactions (ms)

### Priority Fees
Configurable in each operation:
- Token creation: 0.0001 SOL default
- Buying: User specified
- Selling: User specified

## Security Recommendations

1. Keep your `.env` file secure and never share it
2. Backup `private_keys_backup.json` safely
3. Use different wallets for different purposes
4. Monitor wallet balances before operations
5. Test with small amounts first

## Error Handling

- Scripts include comprehensive error checking
- Failed transactions are logged
- Balance checks before operations
- RPC connection validation
